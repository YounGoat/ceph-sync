    ceph-sync - Sync tool between local file system and remote object storage.
    cephsync - Alias of command ceph-sync.

SYNOPSIS
    ceph-sync --source <pathname> --target <pathname> [--retry <times>] 
    [--start-over] [--force] [--mapper <js-pathname>]

ARGUMENTS 
    --source <pathname>
    --target <pathname>
    Here, "pathname" SHOULD be a directory, or a JSON file which stores the 
    connection configs to the remote CEPH storage, in which "container" is 
    necessary. And at least one of --source and --target SHOULD represent a 
    remote CEPH storage.

    --retry <times>
    Times to retry when error occurs in some step.

    --start-over
    Start over, ignoring the mark which indicates the position last 
    synchronization moved on.

    --force
    Run even if the target directory already exists and not empty. Only 
    available when sync from remote storage to local file system.

    --mapper <js-pathname>
    An Node.js module which transforms source object / file name to target 
    object / file name.
