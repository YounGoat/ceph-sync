#   ceph-sync Change Log

Notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

##	[0.8.1] - Jan 23rd, 2018

*	Set default value to option `--concurrency`.

##  [0.8.0] - Dec 10th, 2018

*   New option `--prefix` available when the source is CEPH storage.

##  [0.7.0] - Dec 9th, 2018

*   Support `ceph-dual`.

##  [0.6.2] - Dec 4th, 2018

*   Fixed the bug on `fs2ceph()` when option `filter` exists.

##  [0.6.1] - Nov 12th, 2018

Some wonderful optimizations are made in this version:
*   If filename contains no-utf8 characters, an exception will be thrown on running `fs2ceph()` in Linux. In this version, such files will be ignored and an event named __no-utf8-filename__ will be emitted. In cli mode, such cases will be output to log file named __no-utf8-filename.log__ã€‚
*   If the waiting queue becomes longer and longer, `out of memory` exception may be thrown and the process will be terminated. So, a new option named `maxQueueing` with default value 100,000 is now accepted by `fs2ceph()`. When the ceil is touched, the waiting queue will be frozen in 1,000 ms (one second).

Fixed bugs:
*   In previous version, skipped filenames are stored in __ignore.log__ while they SHOULD be stored in __skipped.log__. Now this bug is fixed.

##  [0.6.0] - Nov 8th, 2018

*   New option `--filter` and `--dual-meta-filter` available on synchronising from filesystem to ceph storage.

##  [0.5.0] - Aug 20th, 2018

*   Fixed the bug when connection's container is changed during sync progress.

##  [0.4.1] - Aug 3rd, 2018

*   New command option `--concurrency` accepted.

##  [0.4.0] - Aug 2nd, 2018

*   Upgrade dependency version of `ceph`.
*   Fixed the bug in `ceph2fs` that exception thrown if there is really an object named with slash "/" tailed. Now, such object will be ignored directly.
